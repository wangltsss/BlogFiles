# About
This blog will contain an overview of building a machine learning model from scratch, as well as an introduction to some auxiliary tools and libraries. This blog is intended for those who want to know about machine learning, or learn it at an introductory level. If you are already an expert, you might not find this blog useful.</br>
Personally speaking, machine learning, at my level of proficiency, is more like a math subject rather than a computer science subject. You may feel like you are reading through a math article as a result of that. It involves a lot of linear regression, a lot of calculus and a lot of linear algebra. But don't get too nervous yet as at an introductory level of machine learning, these math concepts also remain relatively easy. </br>
Continue on if you feel more than ready to dive into the ocean of knowledge.
