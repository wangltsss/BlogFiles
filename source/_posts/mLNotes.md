# About
This blog will contain an overview of building a machine learning model from scratch, as well as an introduction to some auxiliary tools and libraries. This blog is intended for those who want to know about machine learning, or learn it at an introductory level. If you are already an expert, you might not find this blog useful.</br>

Personally speaking, machine learning, at my level of proficiency, is more like a math subject rather than a computer science subject. You may feel like you are reading through a math article as a result of that. It involves a lot of linear regression, a lot of calculus and a lot of linear algebra. But don't get too nervous yet as at an introductory level of machine learning, these math concepts also remain relatively easy. </br>
Continue on if you feel more than ready to dive into the ocean of knowledge.

# Concept
To be filled.

## Supervised Learning
In a supervised learning, the model is told what are 'correct answers'. </br>
This kind of machine learning is applied in area of predicting(stock prediction, score prediction, etc.) and classifying the data(differentiate spam emails from normal ones). </br>
Among these two, regression is usually applied when the context requires or provides continuous data, and classification is applied when the data are discrete.

## Unsupervise Learning
In an unsupervised learning, the training data does not have any label. It is the algorithm's goal to find patterns among these data.

# Auxiliary Tools/Libraries

## Pillow
***Pillow*** is a Python library that enables image vectorization and manipulation. The purpose for our interest is to convert training dataset for our machine learning model to vectorized ***numpy*** arrays.

## tkinter
***tkinter*** is a Python library that enables a graphic file selection system.
